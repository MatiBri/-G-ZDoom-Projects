These are some practices that I made years ago when I was a teenager and wants to learn more about programming and game development. Probabbly I would add another ones that are more new and recently.All the projects seen this, are just made for fun, or for do some testings with the ACS language and also ZScript.
    You can also learn a few things about these projects, most of them I learned from ChubzDoomer, a famous mapper and developer that has a Youtube Channel where you can learn more about ACS if you want, I invite you to go and take a look at his channel, called as the same way as I mentioned here.
